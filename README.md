Got it! Here's the updated, clean **`README.md`** that **does not include the full code**—it assumes the code is in the notebook or Python file:

## 👁️ Face and Eye Detection with OpenCV in Google Colab

This project demonstrates how to detect **faces** and **eyes** in an image using **OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifiers**. The implementation runs entirely in **Google Colab**, so there's no need for local setup.

---

### 🔧 Features
- Face detection using Haar cascades  
- Eye detection with improved accuracy  
- Image upload via Colab  
- Adjustable detection parameters  
- Works with most clear frontal face images

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### 📌 Step 1: Open the Notebook  
Open the GOOGLE COLAB NOTEBOOK 

#### 📌 Step 2: Upload Your Image  
Use the Colab interface to upload any image for detection.

#### 📌 Step 3: Run All Cells  
The notebook installs OpenCV, loads the necessary classifiers, and processes the uploaded image.

### ✅ Tips for Better Detection

- Use well-lit, clear, front-facing portraits
- Avoid extreme face angles or occlusions (e.g., sunglasses)
- You can fine-tune detection parameters for better accuracy

---

### 📌 TODOs

- [ ] Add webcam or video support  
- [ ] Switch to MediaPipe for landmark detection  
- [ ] Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Gradio
